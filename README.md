# Book Connect Abstraction Review

This repository focuses on revisiting and evaluating the abstractions created in the "Book Connect" project, this time through the lens of SOLID principles.

## Overview

the focus is on revisiting and evaluating the existing abstractions within the "Book Connect" project. 
The goal is to reflect on their effectiveness, identifying the top three performers and recognizing areas for improvement with the three least effective abstractions. 
As part of this exploration, consideration will be given to applying SOLID principles to refine and enhance the identified weaknesses. The process involves a thoughtful evaluation to strengthen the overall codebase.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Best Abstractions
- Rate your abstractions and highlight the top three based on their effectiveness.
- Explain why these abstractions stand out and contribute positively to the project.

### Worst Abstractions
- Identify the three abstractions that could benefit from improvement.
- Discuss the shortcomings of these abstractions and how they could be refined using SOLID principles.
